# SQL JOINS

> A `JOIN` clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.


- `(INNER) JOIN` return records that have matching values in both tables
- `LEFT (OUTER) JOIN` return ALL records from the LEFT table, and the matched records from the right table
- `RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN` return ALL records when there is a match in either lerft or right table
