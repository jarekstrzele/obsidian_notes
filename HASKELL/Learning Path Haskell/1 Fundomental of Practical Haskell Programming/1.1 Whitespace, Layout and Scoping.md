[[1 Fundamentals]]


- Haskell is a white space sensitive language
- Haskell is an "off-side rule" language
- enforced by compiler
- rules are usually intuitive
- used in `where`, `let`, `do`, and `case ... of` constructs

```haskell
main =
	let
		x = 5
		y = 6
	in print (x + y)
```

`stack ghc -- --fno-code fileName.hs` compile the file but not produce any executable file; it checks only the syntactic correctness

```haskell
f = do
	a
	b
	c
g = do a
	   b
	   c

a:: IO()
a = indefined; b = udefined; c = undefined
main = undefined

	   
```


```haskell
f x y = a + b
	where
		a = x
		b = y

g x y = a + b
	where x = b
		  y = b
		  
```


```haskell
f x = case x of p0 -> a
				p1 -> b

g x = case x of
		p0 -> a
		p1 -> b
```


```haskell
main = let { x = 5; y= 6} in print (x + y)
