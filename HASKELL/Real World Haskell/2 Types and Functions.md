**every expression and function in Haskell has a type**:
- `True :: Bool`
- `"Foo"::String`

>[!info] Type
>the type of a value indicates that it **shares** certain **properties** (concatenate lists, add numbers) with other values of the same type

 >[!info] abstraction
 >The benefit of introducing **abstraction** is that it lets us foget or ignore low-level details.
 >If I know that a value in my program is a sting, I don't have to know the intimate details of how string s are implemented.
 >**Haskell's type system allows us to think ar a very abstract level**
