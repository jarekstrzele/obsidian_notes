# Guards
> Whereas patterns are a way of making sure a value conforms to some form and deconstructing it, **guards** are a way of testing whether some property of a value(or several of them) are true or false.

```haskell
bmiTell :: (RealFloat a) => a -> a -> String  
bmiTell weight height  
    | weight / height ^ 2 <= 18.5 = "You're underweight, you emo, you!"  
    | weight / height ^ 2 <= 25.0 = "You're supposedly normal. Pffft, I bet you're ugly!"  
    | weight / height ^ 2 <= 30.0 = "You're fat! Lose some weight, fatty!"  
    | otherwise                 = "You're a whale, congratulations!" 
```

A guard is basically a boolean expression.

```haskell
myCompare :: (Ord a) => a -> a -> Ordering  
a `myCompare` b  
    | a > b     = GT  
    | a == b    = EQ  
    | otherwise = LT  
```

# WHERE
`where` is just syntactic construct
[[  3.3 let it be | let <bindings> in <expression>]] is an expression

Instead of reapiting use `where`

```haskell
b[[3.3 let it be]]miTell :: (RealFloat a) => a -> a -> String
bmiTell weight height
| bmi <= skinny = "You are underweight"
| bmi <= normal = "You are supposedly normal"
| bmi <= fat = "You are fat!!"
| otherwise = "You are a whale"
where bmi = weight / height ^ 2
     (skinny, normal, fat) = (18.5, 25, 30)
```
