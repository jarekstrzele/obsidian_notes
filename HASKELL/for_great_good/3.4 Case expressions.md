# Case expressions
```haskell
case expression of  pattern -> result
					pattern -> result
					pattern -> result
					...
```

```haskell
head' :: [a] -> a
head' [] = error "No head for empty lists"
head' (x:_) = x

--- the same with case expression
head' :: [a] -> a
head' xs = case xs of [] -> error "No head for empty lists"
					  (x:_) -> x

-- and other version
head'::[a]-> String
head' xs = "The head of list " ++ what xs
	where what [] = "empty"
		  what(x:_) = "it is " ++ x


```
