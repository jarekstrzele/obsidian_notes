`Int` type is an instance of the `Eq` typeclass because the `Eq` typeclass defines behavior for stuff that can be equated.

==We don't make data from typeclasses==.Instead, we first make our data type and then we think about what it can act like.If if can act like something that can be equated, we make it an instance of the `Eq` typeclass


this code generates an error
```haskell
data Person = Person { 
    firstName::String
  , lastName:: String 
  , age :: Int
}
-- Funkcja main
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let mikeD = Person {firstName="Micheal", lastName="Diamond", age=43}
  let adRock = Person {firstName="Adam", lastName="Horovitz", age=43}
  let second_mikeD = Person {firstName="Micheal", lastName="Diamond", age=43}

  print $ mikeD == mikeD 
```

but if you add `deriving(Eq)` every thing will be correct
```haskell
data Person = Person { 
    firstName::String
  , lastName:: String 
  , age :: Int
} deriving(Eq)
-- Funkcja main
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let mikeD = Person {firstName="Micheal", lastName="Diamond", age=43}
  let adRock = Person {firstName="Adam", lastName="Horovitz", age=43}
  let second_mikeD = Person {firstName="Micheal", lastName="Diamond", age=43}

  print $ mikeD == mikeD 
  print $ adRock == mikeD 
  print $ mikeD == second_mikeD 

-- output
True
False
True
```



## `Read` and `Show`
They are typeclasses for things that can be converted **to** or **from** `strings`.

` Show `  is converting values of our  a type to a string
```haskell
data Person = Person {
	firstName :: String ,
	lastName :: String ,
	age :: Int
} deriving (Eq, Show, Read)
```

```bash

```




` Read ` is converting strings to values of out type
