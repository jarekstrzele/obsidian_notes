# Pattern matching
> ==pattern matching== consists of 
>    - specifying patterns to which some data should conform and then
> 	   - checking to see if it does and
> 		   -  deconstructing the data according to those patterns
> 

>When defining functions, you can define separate function boies for different patterns

```haskell
lucky :: (Integral a) => a -> String
lucky 7 = "Lucky number"
lycky x = "SOrry, out of luck"
```

**recursion**
```haskell
factorial :: (Integral a) => a -> a  
factorial 0 = 1  
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1) 
```
factorial 3 -> 3 * factorial 2 
	factorial 2 -> 2 * factorial 1
		factorial 1 -> 1 * factorial 0
			factorial 0 -> 1
		factorial 1 -> 1 * 1
	factorial 2 -> 2 * 1
factorial 3 -> 3 * 2
result= 6

## when pattern matching fail
`"*** Exception: tut.hs:(53,0)-(55,21): Non-exhaustive patterns in function charName`

>when making patterns, we should always include a catch-all pattern!!!

## other examples
```haskell
second :: (a, b, c) -> b  
second (_, y, _) = y 

addVectors :: (Num a) => (a, a) -> (a, a) -> (a, a)  
addVectors (x1, y1) (x2, y2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2) 
```

```bash
ghci> let xs = [(1,3), (4,3), (2,4), (5,3), (5,6),(3,1)]
ghci> xs
[(1,3),(4,3),(2,4),(5,3),(5,6),(3,1)]
ghci> [a+b | (a,b) <- xs]
[4,7,6,8,11,4]
ghci> 

```

## pattern  `x:xs`
>It only matches against list of length 1 or more !!!!

```haskell
head' :: [a] -> a  
head' [] = error "Can't call head on an empty list, dummy!"  
head' (x:_) = x 
```

#haskell/error
`error` functin takes a string and genetates a runtime error and causes teh program to crash !!!

---
## patterns xs@(x:y:ys)
`source@how_break`
`xs@(x:y:ys)` this pattern will match exactly the same thing as `x:y:ys` but you can easily get the whole list via `xs` instead of repeating yourself by typing out `x:y:ys` in the function body again
```haskell
capital :: String -> String  
capital "" = "Empty string, whoops!"  
capital all@(x:xs) = "The first letter of " ++ all ++ " is " ++ [x]
```
