>[!info] List
>a list is a structured type that contains a sequence of elements, 
>==all of the same type==

```haskell
[]
[3,6,3] :: [Int]
[(1, 'a'), (21, "dwadzieÅ›cia jeden")] :: [(Int, String)]
[[8], [1,2,3], [1 .. 10]] :: [[Int]]
```



# List Constructors
Lists have two **constructors**
> `[]` 
> `[] :: [a]`

> and `:`:
> `(:) :: a -> [a] ->[a]`

`[15,12,21` is a shortcut for `15 : 12 : 21 : []` 
which means `15 : (12 : (21: []))`


Lists in Haskell are simply linked lists.
```haskell
l1 = 3:2:1:[]
l2 = 4:l1

-- 4->3->2->1->x
```

# Lists and Patterns
Pattern discrimination allows to decompose lists:
```haskell
sum [] = 0
sum (x:xs) = x + sum xs
```

### `list = first_elem : rest_list`
