INTRO:
*problem* : you want to have a structure to save some data without behaviors

- often in programming we need instances whose sole purpose is to encapsulate data
- built-in data structures (list, tuple, dict) are not usefull in large projects
- defining a new class for that purpose is overhead

**dataclass** solves this problems
