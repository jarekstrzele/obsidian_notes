`get_url()` is used to get the public URL of a file in Firebase Storage. If you want to make a file public and get its URL, you can pass `None` as the argument to `get_url()`. This will generate a public URL that anyone can access.

Note that if you want to control access to a file, you can set up Firebase Storage rules to restrict access. In that case, you would need to pass a valid authentication token to `get_url()` to get a URL that can access the file.
