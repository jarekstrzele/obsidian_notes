**computer science** is all  about information and with it solving problems

**solving :
`input ---> [  ] ---> output`
so:
	- how to represent `input` and `output`
	- how write the solution `[ ]`

**binary digit** -> *bit* : `0` or `1`

Computers have millions transitiors/switches/light_bulb

ABSTRACTION - simplification of something that you don't want to focus on the lower level implementation details 


`input ---> [ A L G O R I T H M  ] ---> output`
algorithm - step by step instruction to solve a problem
