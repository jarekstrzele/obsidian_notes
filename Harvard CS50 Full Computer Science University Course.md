**computer science** is all  about information and with it solving problems

**solving :
`input ---> [  ] ---> output`
so:
	- how to represent `input` and `output`
	- how write the solution `[ ]`

**binary digit** -> *bit* : `0` or `1`

Computers have millions transitiors/switches/light_bulb

ABSTRACTION - simplification of something that you don't want to focus on the lower level implementation details 


`input ---> [ A L G O R I T H M  ] ---> output`
algorithm - step by step instruction to solve a problem  


## The phone book search problem

### Pseudocode
1. Pick up phone book
2. Open to middle of the book
3. Look at page
4. If person is on page:
	1. call the person
5. else if person is earlier  in book:
	1. open to middle  of left  half of book
	2. go back to 3
6. else if person is later in book:
	1. open to middle of right of book
	2. go back to 3
7. else
	1. QUIT

source code - code writing by human
machine code - code understood by computer

source code -->  `[ COMPILER  ]` ---> machine code

Goals -> code:
- correctness (do what have to do)
- design ()
- style

use `Visual Studio Code`

## `hello world` program
`hello.c`
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void){
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

in terminal
```bash
$ make hello
$ ./hello
hello, world
$ 
```
source code`hello.c` --> [make] ---> machine code `hello`
