# HTTP Architecture

Resources are really the centerpiece of HTTP.

Given a URL, I can locate a resource or I can hand the URL to someone else by embedding it in a hyperlink or sending it in an e-mail.

#### URL cannot:
- restrict the client or the server to a specific type of technology. (everybody speak HTTP, it doesn't matter if your client is in Ruby and a server app in C++)
- force the server to store the resource using any particular technology
- specify the representation of a specific resource and a resource can have multiple representations (e.g. one in 
 HTML, PDF, French, English, ...)
- say what a user wants to do with a resource

#### URL can
**URL** - you think about it as a pointer or a unit of indirection between a client and a server application
*client* --> link/URL --> *server*
(
	URL doesn't dictate:
		- the technology implementation, 
		- a specific resource representation
		- a client's intention (e.g. get data, change data, ...)

Instead:
the client expresses the desired intention and representation in an HTTP message.
an HTTP message is a plain text
)
==request and response== are fully self-describing, standardized, are easy to parse

==the request message==
- includes the HTTP
	-  method which describe what the clinet wants to do (e.g. `GET`)
	- path to the resource (`GET /maps?q=eep+dish+pizza HTTP/1.1`)
	- additional headers:
		- e.g. what representation the client want (`Accept-Language`: fr-FR)
- 
==response== incluedes:
- status code to indicate the result of transaction (`HTTP/1.1 200 OK`)
- headers with cach instructions `Cache-Control`, `Content-Type`, `Content-Length` ....

## Adding value
an HTTP msg (client) ---- ==moves to== -----> to server machine
this ==move== is through several piees od software and hardware (may be this msg will be modify)

==e.g.== a general scenario
- *Web Server Process* is one of the first recipient od an incoming HTTP msg on a server machine
- the web server is responsible for routing messages to the proper app (e.g. a server hosting: `maps.com` in PHP, `bloviate.com` in ASP, `spackle.com` in C++ )
- web server peeks to the header of the incoming HTTp msg and knows for which app is this msg

Web Servers can also perform additional actins with msgs:
- log to the file system
- compress
- ...

## Proxies
These self-describing, visible HTTP msgs allow us to use proxy servers

a client ---- > a proxy server -----> a server

>[!a proxy server]
> - it is a server that sits bwetween a client and a server
> - it is mostly transparent ot the end user
> - one popular role for a proxy server is an access control device (e.g. no social media in an office)
> - it can remove confidential data from mgs (e.g. strip out the referer header from HTTP msgs, if that refer points to an internal resource inside the company network)
> - an access control proxy can also log all the HTTP msgs create audit trails on traffic

> [!forward proxy]
> it is  usually closer on the network to the cloient than it is to a server
> >it provide some benefits to a company

>[!reverse proxy]
>It is a proxy serve that's usually closer to a server than it is to the client
>it provide some benefits to a specific webside


## Proxy services
Proxies can perform a wid range of services.
- it can transmitt msgs to a server that is not so busy that others are
- it can direct requests to different servers depending on the content types
- it can implement SSL acceleration
- it can filter out potentially dangerous HTTP msgs
- ic can store copies of frequently-accessed resources (and use it to respond) (it is a caching)

## Caching
>[!caching]
>It is an optimization, to improve performance and scalability

When there are multiple requests for the ame resource representation, a server can send the bytes over the network tima and time again for each request
ot
a proxy server ot a client can cache the representation locally and reduce the amount of time and  bandwidth required for full retrieval.

### two types of caches
#### a public cach
It is a cach shared among multiple users.
It generally resides on a proxy server

#### a private cache
it is dedicated to a single user
Web browsers keep a private cache of resources on your disk (e.g. `chrome://cache`)

You can cache: `get`
Don't cache: `put, post, delete`

An HTTP reponse can have a value for cache control of public (`Cache-Control: ....`)

directive  | meaning
--- | ---
public | a response for everyone
private | a response for a single user
no-cache | don't cache the response
no-store | you never saw this response
