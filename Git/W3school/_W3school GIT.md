Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since than.

Git is used for:
- tracking code changes
- tracking who made changes
- coding collaboration

## Working with Git
- initialize Git on a folder, making it a __Repository__
- when a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered __modified__
- you select the modified files you want to __Stage__
- The staged files are __committed__, which prompts Git to store a __permanent__ snapshot of the files

## GitHub
- Github makes tools that use Git
- Git is not the same as GitHub
