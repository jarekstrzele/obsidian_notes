Variables exist only in their scope.

### integer
`sbyte` -128 to 127
`short` bigger
`int` bigger
`long` very long integer

### float
`float x= 99.99f`
in graphics libraries
### double
`double x = 1.5;` (15 digit precision)
for real world values
### decimal
`decimal x = 1.5` (28-digit precision)
in financial applications

# value type and reference type
How they occupy memory location?

## Value type
- store actual data directly
- typically stored in the stack
- include int, float, long, double, char bool, decimal, struct, enum
- nullable versions available(int?, double?, )

## reference type
- reference type is a variable type which instead of storing the value in memory directly, STORES THE MEMORY LOCATION of the actual data
- stores the memory reference of the data and not the data directly
- string, class, array...
- when we copy this reference type of a data type it will just copy the memory address of the data so we will then have two variables pointing to the same data
