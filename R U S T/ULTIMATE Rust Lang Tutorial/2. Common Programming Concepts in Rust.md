# Variables and Constants
- variable a immutable by default - `let x: i32 = 5 ;`
- `let mut x: i32 = 5` - this variable `x` is mutable
- `const CONSTANT_NAME_PI: i32 = 3.15`
	- constants are enable to be `mut`
	- constants must have type annotations `: i32`
	- constants are not expression so, they can be returned by functions
	- you can use `_`  notations `100_000`

**shadowing**:
```rust
let x: i32 = 5;
//...
let x: i32 = 6 ; // this x shadows x=5
```
advantages:
- preserve mutability (first `x` is immutable, and second `x` is also immutable)
- you can cach
