[[_ LetsGetRusty Ultimate Rust Lang Tutorial]]


# Variables and Constants
- variable a immutable by default - `let x: i32 = 5 ;`
- `let mut x: i32 = 5` - this variable `x` is mutable
- `const CONSTANT_NAME_PI: i32 = 3.15`
	- constants are enable to be `mut`
	- constants must have type annotations `: i32`
	- constants are not expression so, they can be returned by functions
	- you can use `_`  notations `100_000`

**shadowing**:
```rust
let x: i32 = 5;
//...
let x: i32 = 6 ; // this x shadows x=5
```
advantages:
- preserve mutability (first `x` is immutable, and second `x` is also immutable)
- you can change type - second `x` --- `let x:&str  = "new x with string" ; `
-

# data types

## scalar
It represents a single value
they are:
### integer 
`i8`, `u8` --> `i128`, `u128` 
and also `isize`, `usize` <- it depends on the architecture
```rust
let a: i32 = 98_222; // DECIMAL
let b: i32 = 0xff ; // Hex
let c: i32 = 0o77 ; // Octal 
let d: i32 = 0b1111_0000 ; //
let e: u8 = b'A' ; // Byte

let f: u8 = 255 ;

```

### float
```rust
let f: f64 =2.0 ;
let g: f32 = 3.0 ;
```





- boolean
- character

## compound
it represents a group of values
