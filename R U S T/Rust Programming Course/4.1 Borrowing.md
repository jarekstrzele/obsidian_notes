```rust
  let mut vec_1: Vec<i32> = vec![4,5,6] ;
  //let ref1: &mut Vec<i32> = &mut vec_1;
  //let ref2: &mut Vec<i32> = &mut vec_1; //error can;t have to mutable references
  let ref1: &Vec<i32> = &vec_1;
  //let ref2: &mut Vec<i32> = &mut vec_1; //error can;t have to mutable references
  let ref2: &Vec<i32> = &vec_1;
  
  
  println!("ref1: {:?}, ref1: {:?}, ref2: {:?}", ref1, ref1, ref2) ;
```

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut vec_1: Vec<i32> = vec![4,5,6] ;
  let ref1: &Vec<i32> = &vec_1;
  //let ref2: &mut Vec<i32> = &mut vec_1; //error can;t have to mutable references
  let ref2: &Vec<i32> = &vec_1;
  println!("ref1: {:?}, ref2: {:?}", ref1, ref2) ;
  // end of the scope for immutable refrences
  
  let ref3: &mut Vec<i32> = &mut vec_1 ;
  println!("ref3: {:?}", ref3) ;
}

```


```
ref1: [4, 5, 6], ref2: [4, 5, 6]
ref3: [4, 5, 6]
```



# Borrowing in functions
```rust


fn main() {
  
  let vec_1: Vec<i32> = vec![1,2,3] ;
  let ref1: &Vec<i32> = &vec_1 ; 
  borrow_vec(ref1) ;
  println!("vec_1 {:?}", vec_1);
}

fn borrow_vec(vec: &Vec<i32>){
    println!("borrow_vec {:?}", vec) ;
}

```

```
borrow_vec [1, 2, 3]
vec_1 [1, 2, 3]
```


```rust
fn main() {
  
  let mut my_vec: Vec<i32> = vec![10,20,30] ;
  
  println!("my vec: {:?}", my_vec);
  mutably_borrows_vec(&mut my_vec) ;  
  println!("my vec: {:?}", my_vec);
    
}

fn mutably_borrows_vec(v: &mut Vec<i32>){
    v.push(30) ;
}
```

```
my vec: [10, 20, 30]
my vec: [10, 20, 30, 30]
```


```rust
fn main() {
    let mut some_vec = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let first = get_first_element(&some_vec);
    //some_vec.push(4); //cannot borrow `some_vec` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
    println!("The first number is: {}", first);
    some_vec.push(4);

    /*
    The problem with borrowing arises when we attempt to modify the some_vec vector 
    after obtaining an immutable reference to its first element. 
    This situation violates Rust's borrowing rules, which dictate that
    we cannot modify a variable
    while immutable references to it are still in scope. 
    
    This rule ensures the safety and integrity of data in Rust, 
    preventing potential conflicts and data races
    */
}

fn get_first_element(num_vec: &Vec<i32>) -> &i32 {
    &num_vec[0]
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut vec_1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let vec_2 = vec![4, 5, 6];
    let mut vec_ptr: &Vec<i32>;
    vec_ptr = &vec_1; // The type of vec_ptr is a reference to a vector so
    // we should borrowing and not take ownership. 
    println!("vec ptr is pointing to vec_1");
    vec_ptr = &vec_2; // We need to borrow using a reference and 
    not take ownership. 
    println!("vec ptr is updated and now pointing to vec_2");
}
```


```rust

fn main() {
    let mut first_num = 42; // we are using mutable references to it so the variable must be mutable
    let mut second_num = 64; // we are using mutable references to it so the variable must be mutable
    let ref1 = &mut first_num;
    let mut ref2 = &mut second_num; // a mutable references means that the reference can be updated to point to some other variable

    *ref1 = 15;
    *ref2 = 10;
    ref2 = ref1;

    println!("Updated first number: {ref2}");  
}

```

**Dereferencing Mutable References**:
```rust
*ref1 = 15;
*ref2 = 10;

```

- `*ref1` accesses the value that `ref1` is referencing, which is `first_num`. The line `*ref1 = 15;` updates `first_num` to `15`.
- `*ref2` accesses the value that `ref2` is referencing, which is `second_num`. The line `*ref2 = 10;` updates `second_num` to `10`.




# Dereferencing
