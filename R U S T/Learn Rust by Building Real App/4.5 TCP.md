# errors
> [!imporant] RUST DOESN'T  NOT SUPPORT EXCEPTIONS
> 
> Rust has the `Result` for hanfling recoverable errors
```rust
pub enum Result<T, E>{
   // Contains the success value
   Ok(T),
   // Contains the error value
   Err(E)
}
```




In Rust errors can be:
- recoverable (e.g. a file not found error) ; it can be hndler
- unrecoverable  (e.g. trying to access an index beyond the end of on the array)
