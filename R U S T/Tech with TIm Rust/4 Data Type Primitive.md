# Scalar data type
>[!info] SCALAR DATA TYPE
>A scalar data type is something that has a finite set of possible values, following some scale, i.e. each value can be compared to any other value as either equal, greater or less

## Integer
`let x = 2 ;` implicite this is integer type
`let x: i32 = 2 ;` explicite integer type

negative and positive number: `i8, i16, i32, i64, i128` 
only 

# Compound data type
>[!info] COMPOUND DATA TYPE
>in Computer science, a composite data type or compund data type is any data type which can be constructed in a program using th programming language's primitive data types and other composite types
> - tuple
> - array
