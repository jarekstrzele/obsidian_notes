#rust/file

``

> This code consists of instructions importing Rust's standard library: `std::fs::File` and `std::io::prelude::*`.
> `std::fs::File` enables file operations such as creating, reading, writing, and deleting files.
> `std::io::prelude::*` contains basic types and structures, such as `Read` and `Write`, that are used in input/output (I/O) operations.
> The `use` statement allows using these libraries without the need to specify their full names every time they are used. For example, instead of writing `std::fs::File::open("file.txt")`, you can simply write `File::open("file.txt")` after importing `std::fs::File`.
