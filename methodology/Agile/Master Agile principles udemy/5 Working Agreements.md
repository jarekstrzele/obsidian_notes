#scrum/ready
>[!imporant] definition of  Ready
> ( 
>  - one of the most important part of the working agreement
>  - Scrum Master is responsible for a definition of Ready
>  - usually definition already applies to the user story
>  )
>  **READY** means the user story contains enough details to be worked


#scrum/done
>[!imporant] definition of  Done
> ( 
>  - definition of Done cam helps team increase their productivity
>  - Start with a simple lightweigh DOD document (chacklist?)
>  )
>  **DONE**  (it is some sort of checklist)
>       - the document is accessible by everyone in the team
>       - it is a common understanding of how to work with each other
>       - user story meets the acceptance criteria provided by the product owner
>       - the user story (or that unit of work) must be properly tested
>       - code review is done by another developer in the team
>       - small (relevant) note on that user story on how it was implemented
>       - story is given to Product Owner for final review

 DOD  is set for the project, not individual stories
