# 4 values
#### 1. individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- we value people and we avlue interactions among them
- we value face to face communication
- we estimate more interaction than the actual result 

#### 2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
the main deliverable is the software, but of course docs are important

#### 3. customer collaboration over contract negotiation
we want to collaborate and delight our customers!


#### 4. responding to change over following a plan
let's value being ready for changes and responding to any change
