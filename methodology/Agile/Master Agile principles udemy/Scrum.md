Scrum recommends a self-organizing and cross-functional team.

Outside of software, Scrum is used in operations, startups, government, and marketing


Scrum's root come from empirical process control framework that values:
- inspection
- adaptation
- transparency

### inspect and adapt
a team picks up the work and they start working, after some time they can learn more abut the ptoblem and the solutuin

scrum says you pick up our problem, you start working on and as you work on it you can look back and inspect and adapt according to what you learn from the process of working itself

### Transparency
It makes scrum framework very effactive because all the roles, responsibilities, the meetings and scrum are designed so thet teamcan be more transparent about how they're working and what they're working on

## The heart of scrum SPRINT (Time-box)
**sprint** is just the time selected by the team anywhere between one to four weeks, where they plan the work
