# Backlog
Sprint ==BACKLOG== comes out of the sprint planning meeting:
- it is amount of work that the team member agreed to work on
- e.g. > a two week interation > we have about twelve user stories that we can get this done in the next two weeks


## Backlog Grooming (refinement)
==Product Backlog== is reprioritized and user stories are resized & refined (as appropriate) in preparation for the next sprint


> - The Sprint Backlog  is created from the Product Backlog in the Sprint Planning ceremony.
> - the Sprint Backlog contains the user stories the team is committing to complete in the upcoming startup.
