# Sprint Retrospective

It's we're looking at a sprint and we're looking at the retrospective:
- what ==did== the team do well
- what ==didn't== go well in this last sprint
- what ==should== be improved on

a two week iteration > a retrospective after two weeks
It is usually done on the last day of the sprint

==Scrum Master== sets the stage for the team
