> - I want a (some goal or what)
> - so that (I can acheive some value or why)



## Writing Great user Stories
A user story is not a document? It is more of a conversation (a lightweight description of waht the user might want in this software)
> **The 3 C's:
>  - Card (short description)
>  - Conversation (team conversation about cards)
>  - Confirmation (the team will go talki to the product owner) to confirme what they have understood to compare their understanding with what product owner or customers  have in mind

### INVEST
#scrum/invest
a simple format of a user story: **as a (user), I wnat (goal) so that I can (value or why)**.
but this more complex - under this pattern are:
1. **independent** when your are writing a user story you don't have any dependency with any other user story
2. **negotiable** the user story should be flexible (it can change and adapt to the needs of the user)
3. **valuable** - the user story has some concrete value to the users
4. **estimatable** - if you have a user story, you should have some idea on how much complexity this user story has
5. **Small** it should be small enough for team members to finish this in a few days
6. **testable** you should be able to test that user story




## Acceptance Criteria
#scrum/acceptance_criteria
>[!imporant] definition of Acceptance Criteria
> - are simple notes or conditions added to the user story
> - tells what the user story must do to satisfy the needs of the customer - defined by the Product Owner

they  show up in the Confirmation phase of the 3 C's (above)

Acceptance Criteria enriches the user story by making it testable and ensures the story is ready to for demo,

Product Owner Writes the initial Acceptance Criteria and brings them to discuss with the team.
