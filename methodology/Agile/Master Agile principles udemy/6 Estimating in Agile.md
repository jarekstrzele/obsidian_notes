# Estimating in Agile

## Estimating in general
>[!important] estimating
> - roughly (z grubsza) calculating/guess:
> 	- how long it's going to take us to complete the user story
> 	- from beginning to done

USED TO ESTIMATE:
- ==elicited information== (you've gathered it from stakeholders: their needs, their wants, the core of that particular user story )
- ==past experiences== (other projects, other user stories that are similar to this one )
- ==documentation== (you organization may have some standards codumentation for estimating)

## Estimating in Agile

Agile | Non-Agile
--- | --- 
relative estimate in side the project | absolut estimate
placed into a bucker  | measured in days
updates usually cause minor impact | updates usually cause major impacts

**We estimate in Agile to**:
1. Provide estimated duration
2. Drive out clarification questions
3. Highlight complex and high risk tasks

## Common Estimation Techniques
- ==Big/Uncertain/Small (BUS)==
	- three buckets (categories): big, uncertain, small
	- each user story is compared to others and assigned to a group
		- 'Big' stories should be  broken up if possible
		- 'uncertain' stories need to be groomed or broken up
- ==T-Shirt sizes==
	- categorized into typical t-shirt sizes
	- XS, S, M, L, XL
	- each user story is compared to others and assigned a t-shirt size
	- larger stories should be broken up if possible
- ==Fibonacci sequence==:
	- abstract value to represent size: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,...
		- this number are called story points
		- how many points that story will need, in order to be completed
		- numeric value representing the effort needed to complete a user story assigned by the development (Scrum) Team
	- each user story is compared to others and assigned "Story Points"
		- larger stories hould be broken up if possible
	- Number of points per sprint is the team's velocity
