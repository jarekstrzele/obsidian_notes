# Create a mobile game to explore STATE management

```kotlin
@Composable  
fun CaptainGame(){  
	val treasuresFound = remember{ mutableStateOf(0) }  
  
}
```
`remember` is like the captain's logbook.==:
- it remembers the ship has been and what treasures have been found
`mutableStateOf` is like the ship's steering wheel
