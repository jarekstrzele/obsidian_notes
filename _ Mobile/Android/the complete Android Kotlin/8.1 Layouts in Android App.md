# Linear layout
Make a new project `Empty View Activity` 
Default layout is Constraint
to change it:
	- Palette>Layouts or 
	- you can change xml 
`activity_main.xml`:
CHANGE : `<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns: ..."`
INTO
```xml
<LinearLayout xmlns: ...
			  ...
android:orientation="vertical" />

``````

You can move `Button` form `Palette` to `Component Tree`
The componentsÂ are stacked one below the other. 

If you replace "vertical " with "horizontal", if you have added textView and two Buttons, these buttons disappear (you have to change `layout_width` to `wrap_content`)

==`match_parent`== the layout will cover the entire screen
==`wrap_content`== the layout will be big enough to enclose the whole content

`layout_width/height` can be `match_parent`, `wrap_content` or *a number* (e.g `300dp`)

you can have nested layout


# Relative Layout is out of date
in `activity_main.xml`:
```xml
...
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android ...
				
```
It is very old 

add buttons in xml add to `<Button...`
```xml
<Button
		 ...
	android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"  
	android:layout_centerVertical="true"
	...
```


# Constraint Layout in Android 11
- This layout gives you adaptable and flexible ways to create views for apps
- this allows you to create latge, complexm dynamic and responsive views in a flat hierarchy
- constraint layout in Android studio 3.0 or higher

If you add a button to ConstraintLayout, you have to set constraints to that button
If you add a component  to the constraint layout, and you don't set constaints properties of the component, it will be send to `(0,0)` position (the top left corner  of the screen)
