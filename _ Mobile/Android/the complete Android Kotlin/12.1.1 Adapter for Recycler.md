[[12.1 Recycler View]]

When creating an adapter class for `RecyclerView` in Android, there are several key functions that you typically need to implement to manage your data items and bind them to views. However, among the commonly mentioned functions, the one that is **not** required to be implemented as part of the `RecyclerView.Adapter` abstract class is:

- `onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType)`: Responsible for creating a new `ViewHolder` object whenever the `RecyclerView` needs a new one. This is where you inflate your item layout and initialize the `ViewHolder`.
    
- `onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder holder, int position)`: Used for binding data to the views within the `ViewHolder`. This is where you set the data that needs to be displayed by the `ViewHolder` at a specific position in the data set.
    
- `getItemCount()`: Returns the total number of items in the data set held by the adapter. This is used by the `RecyclerView` to determine the number of items.
    

Among the commonly mentioned functions related to the `RecyclerView.Adapter`, all the above are essential. The function that is **not** typically mentioned as one you "should implement" because it's not part of the `RecyclerView.Adapter` class's core abstract methods is:

- `getItemViewType(int position)`: Although not required, this method is used when you have multiple view types in a single `RecyclerView`. This method is overridden to return the view type of the item at the given position, allowing the adapter to use different types of views in the same `RecyclerView`. While `getItemViewType` is useful in multiple view type scenarios, it is not a function that you **must** implement for every `RecyclerView.Adapter`. If your `RecyclerView` uses a single view type for all items, you don't need to override this method, as the default implementation will suffice.

So, `getItemViewType(int position)` is the method that, while important in certain contexts, is not one of the functions you are required to implement for a basic `RecyclerView.Adapter` setup.
