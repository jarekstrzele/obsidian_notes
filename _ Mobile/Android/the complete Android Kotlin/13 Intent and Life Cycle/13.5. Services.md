# Types
## Foreground  Services
- user can see the process
- e.g. app is downloading a file in the background and at the foregorund service user needs to see notifications about downloading


## Background Services
- the user doesn't even see the process
- the app doesn't show any notifications 
- e.g. compressing photos in the smartphone (a user takes a photo, the photo is store in memory, so the app compresses the photo, and the user event doesn't know that the photo is compressed )


## Bound Services
- this is dependent on the component that call its self,
- the service interacts with the component 
- when a component is stopped, the service is stopped - it doesn't work in the background *client-server* relation
- e.g. a music player - when that app is runnign bound services are running, when the app is stopped, the bound services are stopped

# Service Classes
## Traditional Service Classes
- `Service Classes` takes  on:
	- the whole task  all by itself,
	- uses the main thread of the app
	- if your service task is small, you can use this standard service class
- `Job Intent Service Classes` :
	- don't use the main thread of the app
	- create another work thread
