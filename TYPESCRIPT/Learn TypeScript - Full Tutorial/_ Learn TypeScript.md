>[!info] TypeScript
>- a superset of JavaScript
>- it doesn't add more features
>- it is about type safety
>	- not safety in JS:
>		- 2+"2" -> 22
>		- null + 2 -> 2
>		- undefined + 2 -> NaN
>- it is a development tool (the project still runs JS, in production it is JS)

**What Type Script does**:
- ==static checking== - whenever you are writing the code, the parser of the language or the entire of the language is constantly being analyzed by the IDE's.

development fow:
- you write your code in `.ts` (in React `.tsx`),
- that code is being transpiled into JS
