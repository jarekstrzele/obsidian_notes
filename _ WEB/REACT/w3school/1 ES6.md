## React ES6 Classes
#rjavascript/class
- A class is a type of function.
- To initiate it you use the keyword `class` instead of the keyword `function`.
- the properties are assigned inside a `constructor()` method

```js
class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }

  present(){
	  return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
  }

}

const mycar= = new Car("Ford");
mycar.present();
```


```sql
class Model extends Car{
  constructor(name, mod){
	  super(name);
	  this.model = mod;
	  
  }
  show(){}
  
}

cinst mycar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
mycar.show()
```

`super()` refers to the parent class

## Arrow Functions
#react/arrow

If function has onlu one statement:
`hello = (val) => "Hello world " + val;`

and if you have only one parameter, you can skip the parentheses as well:
`hello = val => 'Hello ' + val;`

### `this`
In regular functions the `this` keyword represented the object that called the function (window, document, button ...).

With arrow functions, the `this` keyword __always__ represents the object that defined the arrow function (with arrow functions there are no binding of `this`).

## VARIABLES
`var`:
- outside of a function, a variable has a global scope,
- inside of a function,a variable belongs to that function,
- inside of a block (i.e. a for loop), the variable is still available outside of the block
>`var` has a function scope, not a block



`let`:
- is a block scope version of `var` (is limited to a block or expression where it is  defined)
- inside of a block (i.e. for loop), the variable is only availble inside that loop
>`let` has a block scope



`const`:
- it does not define  a constant value. 
- it defines a constant reference to a value  
 ->:
	- you can change the elems of constant array
	- you can change the properies  of constant object

>`const` has a block scope

## ARRAY Methods
#javascript/map

One of the most useful method in React is the `.map()` array method.

`.map()`:
- runs a function on  each item in the array
- returns a new array as a result

 ```js
 const myArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

const myList = myArray.map((item) => <p>{item}</p>)
						   
 ```

---

## DESTRUCTURING
#javascript/destructuring
Destructuring is like making sanwich. To make it you take out of the refrigerator only what you need.

>__destructuring__ makes it easy to extract only what you need

### Desctructing arrays
__the order is imporant__!!
```js
const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

const [car, truck, suv] = vehicles;
```

```js
const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

const [car, , suv] = vehicles;
```


When a function return an array:
```js
function calculate(a, b) {
  const add = a + b;
  const subtract = a - b;
  const multiply = a * b;
  const divide = a / b;

  return [add, subtract, multiply, divide];
}
```

### Destructuring Objects
__The order is not important!!!___

```js
const vehicleOne = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021, 
  color: 'red'
}

myVehicle(vehicleOne);

function myVehicle({type, color, brand, model}) {
  const message = 'My ' + type + ' is a ' + color + ' ' + brand + ' ' + model + '.';
}
```

---

## Spread operator
allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.
```js
const numbersOne = [1, 2, 3];
const numbersTwo = [4, 5, 6];
const numbersCombined = [...numbersOne, ...numbersTwo];
```

The spread operator is often used in combination with destructuring.
Assign the first and second items from numbers to variables and put the rest in an array:
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

const [one, two, ...rest] = numbers;
```

object:
```js
const myVehicle = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  color: 'red'
}

const updateMyVehicle = {
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021, 
  color: 'yellow'
}

const myUpdatedVehicle = {...myVehicle, ...updateMyVehicle}
```
Th color is a yellow!!!!.

## MODULES
>ES modules rely on the `import` and `export` statements.


### EXPORT
#### export name
in two ways:
- in-line individually
```js
export const name = "Jesse"
export const age = 40
```
- all at once at the bottom
```js
const name = "Jesse"
const age = 40

export { name, age }
```

#### export default
>You can only have one default export in a file

```js
const message = () => {
  const name = "Jesse";
  const age = 40;
  return name + ' is ' + age + 'years old.';
};

export default message;
```


### IMPORT
in two ways (based on name export or default export)

#### import from named exports
it must be destructured using curly braces.
```js
import {name, age}  from "./person.js"
```

#### import from default exports
```js
import messafe from "./message.js"
```

## Ternary operator
`condition ? <expression if true> : <expression if false'

```js
authenticated ? renderApp() : renderLogin();
```
