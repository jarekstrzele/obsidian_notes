# How to create npm package

*module* - it is a file
*package* - it is a collection of modules that have beed packaged together

### `npm init` 
- some questions  (`npm iinit -y`)
- create `package.js`
now you can install some packages:
e.g. `npm install axios`

in `package.json`:
```json
"script":{
	"start": "node filenameMAIN.js"
}
```
now `npm run start` or a short version `npm start`

**package.json** + **files** = ==package==

---
# Packages and the `npm` registry

Your application is a package because:
- has `package.json`
- is managed by `nom`

-----
# Using third party modules

- a new folder
- `npm init -y` - it makes  `package.json`
- inside that folder `npm install axios`
- make file `request.js`

`axios.get()` - returns a promise object
`.then()` - returns a promise object
`.catch()` - returns a promise object

if you add `"script: { "start": "node request.js}"`, you will can run the program by writing `npm run start` or `npm start`
