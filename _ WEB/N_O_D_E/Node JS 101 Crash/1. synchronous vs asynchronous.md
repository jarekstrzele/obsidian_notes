[[_ NodeJS 101 Crash Course]]

-----------
>[!info] SYNCHRONOUS
> It means code that runs line by line in sequence

 e.g. Achieve goals
 1. learn html -> next
 2. learn JavaScript -> next
 3. learn Node.js -> next
 4. get hired


>[!info] ASYNCHRONOUS
> - it is often describe as the opposite of synchronous
> - it is code that does't necessarily run line by line

 e.g. Achieve goals
 1. learn html -> still learing, but go to 2.
 2. learn JavaScript ->  still learing, but go to 3.
 3. learn Node.js ->  still learing, but go to 4.
 4. get hired  -> still learing, but go to 1.

# ASYNCHRONOUS CALLBACKS
#javascript/callback

> Node.js is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime

synchronous example:
```js
console.log('🐇 finishes!') ;
console.log('🐢 finishes!') ;

// output
$ node asyncJS.js 
🐇 finishes
🐢 finishes
```

asynchronous
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
	console.log('🐇 finishes!') ;
}, 1000)
console.log('🐢 finishes!') ;

//output
$ node asyncJS.js 
🐢 finishes!
🐇 finishes!
```

>[!info] CALLBACK FUNCTION
>- it allow us to say when you are done doing all of this work call me back and run my code
>- these call backs are executed when some event occurs (e.g. after 1000 milis)
