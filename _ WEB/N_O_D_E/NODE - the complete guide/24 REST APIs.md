# What & Why?
- not every Frontend (UI) requires HTML Pages (mobile Apps)
- Single Page App
- service APIs (e.g. Google Maps API)

Frontend (UI) is decoupled from the backend (server)

>[!definition] REST
>- Representational State Transfer
>- Transfer Data instead of User Interfaces
>	- data format:
>		- HTML (Contains User Interface, but you need only data)
>		- Plain Text (No UI Assumptions, but it is difficult to parse)
>		- XML (No UI Assumptions, Machine-readable, XML-parser needed)
>		- ==JSON (No Ui Assumptions, Machine-readable, Can easilu be converted to JavaScript)==


>[!important]
>Only the response (and the request data) changes, NOT the general server-side logic!
