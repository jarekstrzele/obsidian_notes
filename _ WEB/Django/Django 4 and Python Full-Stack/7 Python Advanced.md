## Errors and Exception Handling
e.g. in our web page we don't have complete information to fulfill a web page request, so we want that instead of this lack our page still operate, even if an error were to occur
You can actually write code for specific error situations.

We use three keywords for this:
- ` try `   this is the block of code to be attempted (may lead to an error)
- `  except  `: Block of code will execute in case there is an error in try block
- ` finally `: a final block of code to be executed, regardless of an error
