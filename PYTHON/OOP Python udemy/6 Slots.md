- an object namespace is a regular dictionary,
- it can be extends infinitally
- so two problems appear:
	- memory (to much memory is used)
	- execution speed

==Slots== are the way to solve that problem

>[!info] SLOTS
>They are class level attributes.
>`__slots__('attr1', 'attr2', ...)`

slots replace an object `__dict__` into **fixed-size array**
`myobject.__dict__` generates `AttributeError`
