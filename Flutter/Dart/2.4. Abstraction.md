# Abstraction
An abstract class is similar to an interface but you can inherit from an abstract class.
```dart
abstract class Car {

  late bool hasWheel;
  late bool hasHorn;

  void honk();
}
```

```dart
import 'car.dart';

class RaceCar extends Car{

  RaceCar(){
    this.hasHorn = true;
    this.hasWheel = true;
  }

  void honk() => print('beeeeep');
}
```
