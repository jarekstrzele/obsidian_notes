[[1.1 Flutter - what is it]]


# Flutter Architecture

1. UI as Code: Build a **Widget Tree** (==no visual drag and drop editor for adding buttons or text, ... only code==)
2. Embrace Platform Differences (Android, iOS) -flutter gives you the full flexibility:
	1. code A for Antroid
	2. code B for iOS
	3. How is Flutter/Dart "transformed" to a Native App?![[Flutter_dart_app.excalidraw | 700]]
3. One Codebase
	1. Flutter directly controls every pixel on the screen
	2. Flutter does not compile your code to some native EQUIVALENCE or NATIVE alternatives
	3. Flutter ships with its own engine which controls the entire screen
