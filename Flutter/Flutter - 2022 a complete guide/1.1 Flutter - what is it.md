# What is Flutter
> **FLUTTER** is a "tool" that alows you build native cross-platform (iOS, Android) apps with one programming langage and code base


**SDK** Software Development Kit - a collection of tools 
- Flutter doesn't work on iOS and Android
- so => it need to be compiled to native machine code for iOS and  native machine code for Android
- Flutter can compile its code to native machine code

also Flutter:
- gives you a framework, a widget library ([[_ 1 Dart intro | Dart ]]) => you can build beautifull apps:
	- re-usable UI building blocks
	- utility functions
	- packages

Flutter vs Dart
- Flutter builds up on Dart (Flutter is a framework for Dart and Dart is a programming language
- Flutter is a collection of tools, a set of features, utility functiona, widgets
- Flutter gives you SDK (all these tools for computing your code )

	5. `lib/main.dart` change into his one
	6. you have to install android studio to have Android emulator 
	7. if emulator is running, in terminal in VS Code `flutter run`
	8. (small change in code -> use `r` key that means **hot reload**) `shift + r`  restarts tha hole app
