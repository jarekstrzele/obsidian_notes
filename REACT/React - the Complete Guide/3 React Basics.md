# React Basics

React makes building complex, interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler

React is all about "Component", because all user interfaces in the end are made up of components:
- reusability
	- don't repeat yourself
- separation of concerns
	- don't do too many things in one and the same place (function)

## How is a component built?
We combine HTML, CSS and JS in all these components and then we combine all of thses components together  to build the entire user interface


> [!important] In React you define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual JS DOM instructions
