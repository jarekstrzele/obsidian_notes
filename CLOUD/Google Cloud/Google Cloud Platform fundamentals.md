## Understanding Google Cloud Platform
#gcp 

>[! gcp]
>- public cloud service provider (services offerd are hosted by Google)
>- from 2008 (Google App Engine), 2010 google Cloud Storage, ...
>- 

> CLOUD COMPUTING
> it is a type of internet-based computing that provides shared computer processing **resources** and **data** to computers and other devices on demand

>CLOUD COMPUTING
>it breaks apart key functions of a computer and then offers them as services -> three kinds of functions:
>	- processing (raw computational power)
>	- storage 
>	- networking


## How GCP is different
Three ways that GCP stands out:
- networking
	- for long-running compute workloads
	-  flexible machine configurations 
	- preemptible virtual machines

- pricing
	- 
- technology & innovation
	- Google Map Reduce
	- "Borg"
	- Kubernetes
	- Tenserflow

# Core Building Blocks

## Compute Services
### compute
e.g.
	> 
	> IAAS ---------- PAAS
	> 

IAAS - Insfrastructure As A Service 
PAAS - Platform As A Service

**From IaaS to PaaS**
At the beginning an app server had all application layers.
but
DB had different characteristics than our other application components -- we split it out into --> its own hardware
This app is as a monolith.

Break monoliths into:
**microcervices**
#microservices 
each elements of that monolithic stack is developed and managed by a single team end to end 

but with microservices appeared a lot of other issues (internet connections, logs, firewalls, ... )
